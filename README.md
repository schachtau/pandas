School District Standardized Test Analysis 
Using the capabilities of Python through the commonly used IDE, Jupyter Notebook, we were able to analyze the trends of standardizeed test scores across different subjects and eventually decide if the allocation of education funds were used in an efficient way and ideally, every dollar spent would give each student the best chcance of success. 
When we manipulate the given data, assuming a proficient analyst uses the correct script for this application, two main trends/conclusions are clear. 
1. Charter school students score significantly higher in both reading and math across all variables (Funding, Size, Grade). Additionally, charter schools in our district score remarkably higher with less funding.
2. Schools with less than 2,000 students posted impressive passing scores around 90%. Our categories of "Size" were Small=<1000, Medium=1000-2000 and Large=2000-5000. Schools that were deemed "Large" in our parameters passed around 58% of the time. Students who attended schools that had less than 2000 kids were fortunate to the tune of a 36% better chance of passing the standardized test.
